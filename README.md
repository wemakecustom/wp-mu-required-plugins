The original plugin is located at https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation

## Rewriting

The plugin was rewritten for better code management/styling and to better integrate with composer.

The usage of Composer and namespaces is not The Wordpress Way so this was never meant to be merged into the official plugin.
